# PG4500_pathfinding
This repo contains a basic setup for pathfinding in Unity.

The project currently contains a scene with a maze that auto-generates on play with a character controller that responds to input (wasd or arrow keys).

## Usage
Modify CharacterControllerInput to your liking and activate the gameobject in the hierarchy view. Movement speed can be set on said script in the inspector.

Mouse click somewhere in the maze places a target tagged target. Do with this as you wish.

The character can also be controlled through wasd and arrow keys.

For educational use only.
