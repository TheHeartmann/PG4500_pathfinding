# PG4500_pathfinding
This repo contains a basic setup for pathfinding in Unity.

The project currently contains a scene with a maze that auto-generates on play with a character controller that responds to input (wasd or arrow keys).

##Character controller tips:
Use Move speed multiplier field on the "Character Controller Physics" script to change how much force the capsule gets.

For educational use only.
